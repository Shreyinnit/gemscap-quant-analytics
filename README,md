# 📊 Gemscap Quant Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a **real-time quantitative analytics prototype** designed to demonstrate **end-to-end system design**, from **live market data ingestion** to **statistical analytics** and **interactive visualization**.

The application ingests live tick data from **Binance Futures WebSocket streams**, resamples it into multiple timeframes, computes key **statistical arbitrage analytics**, and presents the results through an **interactive Streamlit dashboard**.

The system is intentionally designed as a **modular, extensible prototype**, suitable for a **multi-asset trading or quantitative research environment**, rather than a single-use academic project.

## Key Features

### 🔹 Data Ingestion

* Live tick data streamed from Binance Futures using the provided HTML WebSocket tool
* Raw ticks stored in **NDJSON format**
* Defensive ingestion handling for missing, empty, or delayed data feeds

### 🔹 Sampling & Storage

* Resampling of tick data into:

  * **1 second**
  * **1 minute**
  * **5 minute** intervals
* Aggregation logic:

  * **Price** → last traded price
  * **Volume** → summed traded quantity

## Quantitative Analytics

### 🔹 Price Statistics

* Log returns
* Rolling mean
* Rolling standard deviation
* Rolling volatility

### 🔹 Hedge Ratio (OLS Regression)

* Ordinary Least Squares regression to estimate pair relationship

### 🔹 Spread Construction

[
\text{Spread} = Y - \beta X
]

### 🔹 Z-Score

* Rolling normalization of spread using mean and standard deviation

### 🔹 Rolling Correlation

* Time-varying correlation between paired assets

### 🔹 ADF Stationarity Test

* Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to validate mean-reversion assumptions

## Live Analytics Design

The dashboard supports **near-real-time analytics updates**:

* **High-frequency analytics** (spread, z-score, alerts) update every **500 ms**
* **Lower-frequency resampled plots** (1m / 5m) update only when new bars are formed

This design balances **responsiveness**, **computational efficiency**, and **clarity**, closely reflecting real-world quantitative research workflows.

## Alerts & Trading Signals

* User-defined **z-score threshold alerts**
* Simple **mean-reversion trading signal**:

  * **LONG spread**
  * **SHORT spread**
  * **HOLD**

Alerts update in near-real-time as new tick data arrives.

## Visualization

* Interactive charts built using **Plotly**
* Full support for **zoom, pan, and hover**
* Logical dashboard flow:

  1. Market overview (prices, volume)
  2. Pair relationship (hedge ratio, correlation)
  3. Trading signals (spread, z-score)
  4. Statistical validation (ADF test)
  5. Risk metrics (volatility)

## Data Export

* Download processed analytics and signals as **CSV**
* Enables offline analysis and further research

## Installation & Running the App

### Prerequisites

* Python **3.9+**
* `pip`

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application runs locally using a **single command**, as required.

## Architecture & Design Philosophy

The system follows a **loosely coupled, layered architecture**:

* **Ingestion Layer**: Reads and normalizes raw tick data
* **Resampling Layer**: Converts ticks into multiple timeframes
* **Analytics Layer**: Stateless quantitative functions (OLS, spread, z-score, correlation, ADF)
* **Visualization Layer**: Interactive Streamlit dashboard
* **Alerting Layer**: Rule-based alerts driven by live analytics

Design priorities:

* Clarity over premature optimization
* Modularity and extensibility
* Easy replacement of data sources or storage layers

## Architecture & Design Considerations

The system architecture emphasizes clarity, modularity, and extensibility.

- **Diagram Clarity:** The architecture diagram follows the data flow from ingestion to visualization, making system behavior easy to understand.
- **Trade-offs:** Simplicity and debuggability were prioritized over production-scale infrastructure (e.g., NDJSON storage over databases, periodic refresh over true streaming).
- **Extensibility:** Each layer (ingestion, analytics, UI) is loosely coupled, allowing new data sources or analytics to be added with minimal refactoring.
- **Redundancy Handling:** The system gracefully handles empty or delayed data feeds and insufficient samples for analytics.
- **Logging:** While lightweight for this prototype, the design anticipates structured logging and monitoring in a production environment.


## Scaling Considerations

Although the current implementation runs locally, the architecture supports future scaling:

* Replace NDJSON storage with **Redis** or **PostgreSQL**
* Introduce **Kafka** or message queues for ingestion
* Deploy analytics as **microservices**
* Support additional data feeds (REST APIs, CME futures, historical CSVs)

These enhancements can be introduced with **minimal refactoring** due to the modular design.


## ChatGPT Usage Transparency

ChatGPT was used as a development aid for:

* Structuring the project architecture and folder layout
* Debugging Python, pandas, and Streamlit issues
* Improving modularity and code readability
* Drafting documentation and explanations

All generated suggestions were **reviewed, understood, and adapted** before use.
Core analytics logic, mathematical reasoning, and design decisions were **independently validated**.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to:

* Design and implement an end-to-end quantitative analytics system
* Work with real-time financial market data
* Apply statistical arbitrage concepts correctly
* Build interactive, user-friendly dashboards
* Communicate design decisions clearly and professionally
